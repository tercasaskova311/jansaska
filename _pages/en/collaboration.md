## Collaboration with Sponsors

Jan Sáska is a highly technical rider, constantly seeking ways to progress beyond familiar training routines. Even without a large team behind him, he has successfully secured sponsorships to support a full World Cup season. With the right backing, Jan can focus entirely on racing and aim for consistent top-level World Cup results.

As we approach the 2026 season, Jan is looking for sponsors to support the next World Cup campaign, particularly as the series expands into Asia and the USA.  

Jan and his team view mountain biking as a broader and more dynamic sport than simply displaying logos on team jerseys. We believe our vision could align with your brand and offer unique promotional opportunities.

You can learn more about our summer activities on [Instagram @sportsumava](https://www.instagram.com/sportsumava) or our website: [sportsumava.cz](https://sportsumava.cz).  

We can provide e-bikes, experienced MTB guides, and personalized trips designed for your team or clients.
