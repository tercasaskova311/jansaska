I’m **Jan Sáska**, a first-year Men’s Elite XCO MTB rider from the Czech Republic and the current Elite National Champion.  
In my debut elite World Cup season, I’ve been steadily moving up the ranks — most recently finishing **23rd at the European Championship**.  

I’m known as a **super technical rider**, always searching for new ways to progress instead of sticking to familiar training paths. Even without a big team behind me, I’ve successfully built my own support system of sponsors to compete in a full World Cup season.  

With the right support, I’m ready to channel all my energy into racing and aim for **consistent top World Cup results**.
