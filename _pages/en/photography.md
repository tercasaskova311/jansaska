## Photography and Racing

### Growing Up in Šumava

I grew up in the Šumava mountains, cycling and cross-country skiing. Movement has always been at the center of my life—not just as a sport, but as a way to connect with nature. Competitive cycling took me to the top of professional sport, but it also taught me to slow down and notice the world around me. Sport has this unique gift: if you’re willing to go beyond physical achievements, it opens your eyes to beauty and presence in the natural world.

This video is self-documented, an attempt to capture that closeness—the way nature and sport intertwine in the Šumava mountains.

### Family and Tradition

Sports run in my family’s veins. We live through sport, and it is what keeps us together. We run a bike and ski school, manage a ski area, and share our passion with others. But these activities are just the surface—what really drives us is the love for being outside, exploring, and caring for the places we cherish.

Sport, photography, and the mountains are more than hobbies—they are a way of life, a lens through which we experience the world.
