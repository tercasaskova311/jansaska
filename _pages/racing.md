## 🌍 Solid International Performances

- 🔟 **CS Les Menuires — 12th**  
- 🔟 **European Championships, Melgaço — 23rd**

## 🌐 World Cups: Gaining Experience

The World Cup circuit is next-level, both in terms of competition and pressure.  

**Results:**

| Event        | Position |
|--------------|----------|
| Val di Sole  | 56th     |
| Andorra      | 55th     |
| Les Gets     | 49th     |

What stands out: **steady upward movement** (from 56 → 49), closing the gap between Jan and the mid/high pack.  
Each race delivers valuable experience — technical lines, strategy under fatigue, recovery, and race pacing — all feeding into the next challenges.
