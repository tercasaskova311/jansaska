## Profile

Jan is a first-year Menâ€™s Elite XCO MTB rider from the Czech Republic and the current Elite National Champion. In his debut elite World Cup season, he has been steadily moving up the ranks, with a recent result of 23rd at the European Championships.  

Jan is a super technical rider, always exploring ways to progress rather than sticking to familiar training paths. Even without a large team behind him, he has successfully secured sponsors to support a full World Cup season. With the right support, Jan is ready to focus all his energy into racing and aim for consistent top World Cup results.
